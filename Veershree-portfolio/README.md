# Veershree-portfolio

This project was created with [Better Fullstack](https://github.com/Marve10s/Better-Fullstack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines React, Vite SPA, Nestjs, TS-REST, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **React + Vite** - Client-routed React SPA powered by Vite
- **TailwindCSS** - CSS framework
- **Radix UI** - UI components
- **Node.js** - Runtime environment
- **Prisma** - TypeScript-first ORM
- **MongoDB** - Database engine
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Database Setup

This project uses MongoDB with Prisma.

1. Make sure you have MongoDB set up.
2. Update your `apps/server/.env` file with your MongoDB connection URI.

3. Apply the schema to your database:

```bash
pnpm run db:push
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser to see the web application.
The API is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
